## Installation

Use this link to clone my GitHub repository:
```bash
gh repo clone daliayan/foodie
```

From there cd into the backend folder of the application. Once in the correct folder run the following command in your terminal to ensure you have the required gems to run the application:
```bash
bundle install
```

Following this step, you can run the following command to start up the backend server:
```bash
rails s
```

Now that you have the backend server retrieving data in your webpage, you cd back into the foodie folder. Here you navigate into the frontend folder using cd frontend. Now that you're in the correct folder, you can enter the following command into the terminal to start up the application.
```bash
explorer.exe index.html
```
Finally, you can look at restaurants in different cities and contribute to this database!
